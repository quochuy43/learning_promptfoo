The most common and natural translation of &quot;How r u?&quot; (which is a very informal abbreviation of &quot;How are you?&quot;) in French would be:

*   **Ça va ?** (This is the most common and versatile option)

Here are a few other options, depending on the context and your relationship with the person:

*   **Comment vas-tu ?** (More formal, but still friendly)
*   **Comment allez-vous ?** (Very formal, use with someone you don&#39;t know well or someone older than you)
*   **Quoi de neuf ?** (More like &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;)
*   **Salut, ça va ?** (Hello, how&#39;s it going?)
*   **Ça roule ?** (Very informal, like &quot;How&#39;s it rolling?&quot;)

Since &quot;How r u?&quot; is very informal, **&quot;Ça va ?&quot;** is the best choice in most situations.

  There are several ways to translate &quot;How r u?&quot; into French, depending on the level of formality you want to convey:

*   **Formal:**
*   **Comment allez-vous ?** (This is the most formal and polite option, using the &quot;vous&quot; form.)

*   **Informal:**
*   **Comment vas-tu ?** (This is the standard informal option, using the &quot;tu&quot; form.)
*   **Ça va ?** (This is a very common and casual way to ask &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;)
*   **Comment ça va ?** (Similar to &quot;Ça va ?&quot;, but slightly more explicit.)

Given that &quot;How r u?&quot; is very informal, I would recommend using one of the informal options. **&quot;Ça va ?&quot;** is probably the closest in tone.
