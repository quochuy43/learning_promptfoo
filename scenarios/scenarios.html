There are a few ways to translate &quot;How are you?&quot; into Spanish, depending on the level of formality:

*   **Formal:** ¿Cómo está? (This is used when addressing someone you don&#39;t know well, someone older than you, or someone in a position of authority.)

*   **Informal:** ¿Cómo estás? (This is used with friends, family, or people you know well.)

*   **More general (can be formal or informal depending on context):** ¿Qué tal? (This is a more casual way of asking &quot;How are you?&quot; and can be used in many situations.)

*   **Very informal:** ¿Qué pasa? / ¿Qué onda? (These are very casual and slangy, often used with close friends. &quot;¿Qué onda?&quot; is more common in some Latin American countries.)

So, the best translation depends on the context of the conversation and your relationship with the person you&#39;re talking to.
