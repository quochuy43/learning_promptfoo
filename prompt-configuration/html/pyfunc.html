  ## Technical Analysis of Deep Learning

Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence &quot;deep&quot;) to analyze data and extract complex patterns. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Here&#39;s a technical analysis covering various aspects:

**1. Core Concept: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**

*   **Nodes (Neurons):** Basic computational units receiving input, performing a weighted sum, applying an activation function, and producing an output.
*   **Weights:**  Represent the strength of connections between neurons.  These are adjusted during training to improve performance.
*   **Biases:**  Allow neurons to activate even when the input sum is zero, providing flexibility.
*   **Activation Functions:**  Introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex relationships. Common examples include:
*   **Sigmoid:** Outputs values between 0 and 1 (used historically, but prone to vanishing gradients).
*   **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):** Outputs values between -1 and 1 (also prone to vanishing gradients).
*   **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Outputs x if x &gt; 0, otherwise 0 (computationally efficient and mitigates vanishing gradients).  Variants include Leaky ReLU, ELU, and GELU.
*   **Softmax:** Outputs a probability distribution over multiple classes (used in classification).
*   **Layers:** Neurons organized into layers.
*   **Input Layer:** Receives the initial data.
