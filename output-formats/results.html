Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition:

3 * 5 = 15

Then, 2 + 15 = 17

The answer is $&#92;boxed{17}$

  The answer depends on whether you&#39;re following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

*   **If you follow the order of operations (Multiplication before Addition):**
*   3 * 5 = 15
*   2 + 15 = 17

*   **If you solve from left to right (without order of operations):**
*   2 + 3 = 5
*   5 * 5 = 25

**Therefore, the answer is 17, following the order of operations.**
